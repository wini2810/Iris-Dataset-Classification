# Iris-Dataset-Classification
Before implementing any algorithm, I first found out the model which can give highest accuracy for this dataset.

I tested the dataset with three different models called Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tre Classifier.

After testing, KNN was found with highest accuracy with this dataset.

Hence, I further implemented KNN Algorithm to classify the test instances into respective classes.

The classification algorithm in machine learning called K Nearest Neighbor was implemented on Iris flower dataset.

There are total three classes in the dataset 
  1. Iris Setosa
  2. Iris Veriscolor
  3. Iris Virginica
  
The KNN model classified every test instance into above three classes.

Note:- No libraries are used to implement KNN algorithm. The model is built using pure logic.
